        Hi, welcome to this website which displays the moisture level of my plant! 
        The plant has a capacitive moisture sensor that is connected to an Arduino Nano ESP32. 
        The Arduino has WiFi capabilities, which allows me to connect to a websocket on the backend and send the moisture levels to the frontend. 
        There is a "Water Plant" button above this that allows you to water the plant unless it has enough water already.
